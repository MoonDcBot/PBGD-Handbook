We are Greywatch. We do not seek power. We restore balance. We are the quiet force behind order. The line between chaos and control. We do not take sides. We do not escalate. We act with precision, purpose, and restraint.

As members of PBGD, we pledge to:

🛡️ Protect the player base from toxicity, disruption, and imbalance

⚖️ Remain neutral in faction conflicts, focusing on stability and safety

🔥 Respond to emergencies with calm, coordination, and care

🧹 Assist PET and civilians in clearing debris, securing zones, and restoring order

🧠 Think before acting—every move must serve the mission

🤝 Uphold respect for all players, regardless of rank or group

We are not the loudest. We are the most deliberate. Greywatch stands. Greywatch stabilizes. Greywatch endures
