PBGD exists to maintain balance and stability within Pinewood facilities. While other factions may pursue control or dominance, Greywatch stands apart—neutral, observant, and precise. Our role is to limit excessive actions by upperhand groups (such as PBST or TMS) when they threaten the integrity of the server or disrupt peaceful operations.

We do not engage in combat or take sides. Instead, we:

Monitor faction behavior and intervene through roleplay when power is abused

Support PET (Pinewood Emergency Team) by helping clear debris, secure zones, and assist in rescue efforts

Promote fair play and discourage toxic behavior or unnecessary escalation

Act as a stabilizing presence during reactor breaches, lockdowns, and emergencies

PBGD is the quiet force that keeps the facility from tipping into chaos. We are not the loudest—but we are the most deliberate.
