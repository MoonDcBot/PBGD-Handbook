# General Reminders
* Follow the [ROBLOX Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards) and the [Pinewood Builders Game Rules](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/pinewood-builders-game-rules/907637) at all times.
* Be respectful to other members, especially to those who outrank you, weâ€™re all playing to have fun.
* Do not try to evade punishments, evading will only make it worse.
* We are not at war with other groups, hostility towards them is unwelcomed.
* You are not allowed to share/sell accounts with PBGD marks/ranks.
* Follow orders from your superiors and be respectful to your fellow players. Donâ€™t act like youâ€™re the boss of the game.
* Glitching is severely frowned upon, doing this at events can get you on KoS for all sides until the event ends.
* Division commander's can remove a user from a PBGD position for poor behavior, both in the communications server and in-game. This includes toxicity, inappropriate behavior, etc. Anyone who acts in ways not suitable for his/her rank will see that rank revoked.
* Do not steal any assets that relate to Pinewood Builders or its members, including but not limited to; Game assets, uniforms, and community-made artwork. You will be blacklisted if you refuse to remove stolen assets.
* Attacking other on-duty PBGD members is frowned upon and can lead to punishment.
* PBST must have both a rank tag set to PBST and PBST uniform to be counted as PBST! (unless they are Special Defense+ or have a hazmat/core/fire suit) [same for TMS / PET]
