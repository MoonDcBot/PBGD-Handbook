Even though PBGD is a fan division, members are encouraged to represent the group with pride and consistency. Here’s how:

Wear the Official Uniform – available in the group store or issued by admins

Include the PBGD Tag – add PBGD to your Roblox bio, username, or display name to show your affiliation

Example: Greywatch_Responder_PBGD or Bio: Member of PBGD – Neutral Emergency Division

Use Consistent Colors – grey, black, and hazard yellow are signature tones

Respect Pinewood Lore – stay true to the universe and avoid impersonating official PBST or TMS ranks

Representing PBGD helps build recognition and community—even if you're not officially on-duty in-game
