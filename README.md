## Disclaimer
This handbook is an **unofficial, fan-made** resource. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Pinewood Builders, its developers, or any associated entities. All content within this guide is created by fans for fans, with the goal of enhancing the experience and understanding of the Neutrals role.

# General Reminders
* Follow the [ROBLOX Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards) and the [Pinewood Builders Game Rules](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/pinewood-builders-game-rules/907637) at all times.
* Be respectful to other members, especially to those who outrank you, we’re all playing to have fun.
* Do not try to evade punishments, evading will only make it worse.
* We are not at war with other groups, hostility towards them is unwelcomed.
* You are not allowed to share/sell accounts with PBGD marks/ranks.
* Follow orders from your superiors and be respectful to your fellow players. Don’t act like you’re the boss of the game.
* Glitching is severely frowned upon, doing this at events can get you on KoS for all sides until the event ends.
* Division commander's can remove a user from a PBGD position for poor behavior, both in the communications server and in-game. This includes toxicity, inappropriate behavior, etc. Anyone who acts in ways not suitable for his/her rank will see that rank revoked.
* Do not steal any assets that relate to Pinewood Builders or its members, including but not limited to; Game assets, uniforms, and community-made artwork. You will be blacklisted if you refuse to remove stolen assets.
* Attacking other on-duty PBGD members is frowned upon and can lead to punishment.
* PBST must have both a rank tag set to PBST and PBST uniform to be counted as PBST! (unless they are Special Defense+ or have a hazmat/core/fire suit) [same applies for TMS/PET]

# Identity and representation

Even though PBGD is a fan division, members are encouraged to represent the group with pride and consistency. Here’s how:
* Wear the Official Uniform – available in the group store or issued by admins
* Include the PBGD Tag – add PBGD to your ROBLOX bio, username, or display name to show your affiliation, example:
    * Greywatch_Responder_PBGD
    * In the bio: Member of PBGD – Neutral Emergency Division
* Use Consistent Colors – <span style="background-color: white;color: grey;">**grey**</span>, <span style="background-color: white; color: black;">**black**</span>, and <span style="color: yellow;">**hazard yellow**</span> are signature tones
* Respect Pinewood Lore – stay true to the universe and avoid impersonating official PBST or TMS ranks

Representing PBGD helps build recognition and community—even if you're not officially on-duty in-game

# Our Mission

PBGD exists to maintain balance and stability within Pinewood facilities. While other factions may pursue control or dominance, Greywatch stands apart—neutral, observant, and precise. Our role is to limit excessive actions by upperhand groups (such as PBST or TMS) when they threaten the integrity of the server or disrupt peaceful operations.

We do not engage in combat or take sides. Instead, we:
* Monitor faction behavior and intervene through roleplay when power is abused
* Support PET (Pinewood Emergency Team) by helping clear debris, secure zones, and assist in rescue efforts
* Promote fair play and discourage toxic behavior or unnecessary escalation
* Act as a stabilizing presence during reactor breaches, lockdowns, and emergencies
* PBGD is the quiet force that keeps the facility from tipping into chaos. We are not the loudest—but we are the most deliberate.


<br>

# The Greywatch Code
**_We are Greywatch. We do not seek power. We restore balance. We are the quiet force behind order. The line between chaos and control. We do not take sides. We do not escalate. We act with precision, purpose, and restraint._**

As a member of PBGD, you pledge to:
* Protect the player base from toxicity, disruption, and imbalance.
* Remain neutral in faction conflicts, focusing on stability and safety.
* Respond to emergencies with calm, coordination, and care.
* Assist PET and other players by clearing debris, securing zones, and restoring order.
* Think before acting — every move must serve the mission.
* Uphold respect for all players, regardless of the rank or group.

**_We are not the loudest. We are the most deliberate. Greywatch stands. Greywatch stabilizes. Greywatch endures._**
